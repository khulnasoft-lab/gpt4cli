# Gpt4cli Cloud

## Overview

Gpt4cli Cloud is the easiest and most reliable way to use Gpt4cli. You'll be prompted to start an anonymous trial (no email required) when you create your first plan with `gpt4cli new`. Trial accounts are limited to 10 plans and 10 AI model replies per plan. You can upgrade to an unlimited account with your name and email.

Gpt4cli Cloud accounts are free for now. In the future, they will cost somewhere in the $10-20 per month range.

## Privacy / Data Retention

Data you send to Gpt4cli Cloud is retained in order to debug and improve Gpt4cli. In the future, this data may also be used to train and fine-tune models to improve performance.

That said, if you delete a plan or delete your Gpt4cli Cloud account, all associated data will be removed. It will still be included in backups for up to 7 days, then it will no longer exist anywhere on Gpt4cli Cloud.

Data sent to Gpt4cli Cloud may be shared with the following third parties:

- [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) for hosting and database services. Data is encrypted in transit and at rest.
- Your name and email is shared with [Loops](https://loops.so/), an email marketing service, in order to send you updates on Gpt4cli. You can opt out of these emails at any time with one click.
- When billing and payments are implemented, your name and email may be shared with our payment processor [Stripe](https://stripe.com/).
- In the future, your name, email, and metadata on the actions you take with Gpt4cli may be shared with a third party analytics service in order to track usage and make improvements.

Apart from the above list, no other data will be shared with any other third party. The list will be updated when a specific third party is chosen for any of the above services, or if any new third party services are introduced.

Data sent to a model provider like OpenAI is subject to the model provider's privacy and data retention policies.
