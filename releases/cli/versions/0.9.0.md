## Major file update improvements üìÑ
- Much better accuracy for updates to existing files.
- Gpt4cli is much less likely to screw up braces, parentheses, and other code structures.
- Gpt4cli is much less likely to mistakenly remove code that it shouldn't.

## Major improvements to long plans with many steps üõ§Ô∏è
- Gpt4cli's 'working memory' has been upgraded. It is now much better at working through very long plans without skipping tasks, repeating tasks it's already done, or otherwise losing track of what it's doing.

## 'gpt4cli diff' command ‚öñÔ∏è

- New `gpt4cli diff` command shows pending plan changes in `git diff` format.

## Plans can be archived üóÑÔ∏è

- If you aren't using a plan anymore, but you don't want to delete it, you can now archive it.
- Use `gpt4cli archive` (or `gpt4cli arc` for short) to archive a plan.
- Use `gpt4cli plans --archived` (or `gpt4cli plans -a`) to see archived plans in the current directory.
- Use `gpt4cli unarchive` (or `gpt4cli unarc`) to restore an archived plan.

## Custom models!! üß†
### Use Gpt4cli with models from OpenRouter, Together.ai, and more

![gpt4cli-models](https://github.com/khulnasoft/gpt4cli/blob/03263a83d76785846fd472693aed03d36a68b86c/releases/images/cli/0.9.0/gpt4cli-models.gif)

- Use `gpt4cli models add` to add a custom model and use any provider that is compatible with OpenAI, including OpenRouter.ai, Together.ai, Ollama, Replicate, and more.
- Anthropic Claude models are available via OpenRouter.ai. Google Gemini 1.5 preview is also available on OpenRouter.ai but was flakey in initial testing. Tons of open source models are available on both OpenRouter.ai and Together.ai, among other providers.
- Some built-in models and model packs (see 'Model packs' below) have been included as a quick way to try out a few of the more powerful model options. Just use `gpt4cli set-model` to try these.
- You can use a custom model you've added with `gpt4cli set-model`, or add it to a model pack (see 'Model packs' below) with `gpt4cli model-packs create`. Delete custom models you've added with `gpt4cli models delete`.
- The roles a custom model can be used for depend on its OpenAI compatibility.
- Each model provider has an `ApiKeyEnvVar` associated with it, like `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`, `TOGETHER_API_KEY`, etc. You will need to have the appropriate environment variables set with a valid api key for each provider that you're using.
- Because all of Gpt4cli's prompts have been tested against OpenAI models, support for new models should be considered **experimental**.
- If you find prompting patterns that are effective for certain models, please share them on Discord (https://discord.gg/khulnasoft) or GitHub (https://github.com/khulnasoft/gpt4cli/discussions) and they may be included in future releases.

## Model packs üéõÔ∏è
- Instead of changing models for each role one by one, a model packs let you switch out all roles at once.
- Use `gpt4cli model-packs create` qto create your own model packs. 
- Use `gpt4cli model-packs` to list built-in and custom model packs. 
- Use `gpt4cli set-model` to load a model pack.
- Use `gpt4cli model-packs delete` to remove a custom model pack.

## Model defaults ‚öôÔ∏è
- Instead of only changing models on a per-plan basis, you can set model defaults that will apply to all new plans you start.
- Use `gpt4cli models default` to see default model settings and `gpt4cli set-model default` to update them. 

## More commands üíª
- `gpt4cli summary` to see the latest plan summary
- `gpt4cli rename` to rename the current plan

## Quality of life improvements üßò‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
- Descriptive top-line for `gpt4cli apply` commit messages instead of just "applied pending changes".

- Better message in `gpt4cli log` when a single piece of context is loaded or updated.
- Abbreviate really long file paths in `gpt4cli ls`.
- Changed `OPENAI_ENDPOINT` env var to `OPENAI_API_BASE`, which is more standardized. OPENAI_ENDPOINT is still quietly supported.
- guides/ENV_VARS.md now lists environment variables you can use with Gpt4cli (and a few convenience varaiables have been addded) - thanks @knno! ‚Üí https://github.com/khulnasoft/gpt4cli/pull/94

## Bug fixes üêû
- Fix for potential crash in `gpt4cli changes` TUI.
- Fixes for some rare potential deadlocks and conflicts when building a file or stopping a plan stream.
